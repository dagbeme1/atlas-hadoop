Hadoop Project
Overview
Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and processing of large datasets using the MapReduce programming model. It is designed to scale up from a single server to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage.

Features
Distributed Storage: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) stores data across multiple machines.
Scalability: Easily scales to accommodate increasing data volumes by adding more nodes.
Fault Tolerance: Data replication ensures availability and reliability.
High Throughput: Efficiently processes large datasets with high throughput.
Core Components
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.
MapReduce: A programming model for large-scale data processing.
YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): Manages and schedules resources across the Hadoop cluster.
Hadoop Common: Libraries and utilities required by other Hadoop modules.
Use Cases
Data Warehousing: Storing and processing vast amounts of data for business intelligence.
Log Analysis: Processing and analyzing log data for system monitoring and security.
Machine Learning: Training large-scale machine learning models.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Data processing and transformation.
Getting Started
Installation: Follow the official Hadoop installation guide.
Configuration: Configure core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, and yarn-site.xml based on your cluster requirements.
Starting Hadoop: Use start-dfs.sh and start-yarn.sh to start HDFS and YARN respectively.
Basic Commands
HDFS:
List files: hadoop fs -ls /
Upload file: hadoop fs -put localfile /
Download file: hadoop fs -get /hdfsfile localfile
MapReduce:
Run job: hadoop jar hadoop-examples.jar wordcount /input /output
# atlas-hadoop
